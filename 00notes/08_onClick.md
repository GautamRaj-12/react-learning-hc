## onClick()

In React, the onClick event handler expects a function reference that will be called when the specified event occurs.
```
onClick={setColor()} - Don't do this inside onClick
```
- This syntax immediately calls the setColor function when the component renders. It doesn't wait for the click event. As a result, it may not behave as expected and could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. This is not the intended use for event handlers.

```
onClick={setColor("red")} - Don't do this inside onClick
```
- Similar to the first example, this immediately calls the setColor function with the argument "red" when the component renders. It doesn't wait for the click event and could cause issues, especially if the function has side effects or relies on the click event.

```
onClick = {()=>setColor("red")}  - Do This
```
- This is the correct way to handle the onClick event. It creates an anonymous arrow function that, when executed, calls setColor("red"). This ensures that the setColor function is invoked only when the click event occurs.

``` Do This
const handleColorChange = () =>{
    setColor("red")'
}
onCick={handleColorChange}
```
- This is a recommended approach for better code organization. It defines a separate function handleColorChange that sets the color to "red" when called. This function is then passed as a reference to the onClick event. This makes the code more readable, especially when dealing with more complex logic or multiple event handlers.

```
onClick={setColor} - Can be used
```
- This syntax is correct and recommended. When we use onClick={setColor}, we are passing the reference to the setColor function as the event handler. This is a common and concise way to handle events in React.
- In this case, when the click event occurs, React will call the setColor function. It's assumed that setColor is a function that handles the logic of changing the color. This approach is efficient and often used when the event handler doesn't require any additional parameters or customization for that specific event.
